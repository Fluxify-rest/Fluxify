export const MCP_INSTRUCTIONS = `Fluxify is a low-code backend platform. You build APIs and background jobs as graphs of blocks.

Before building anything, read https://docs.fluxify.rest/llms.txt. It indexes every docs page; fetch the pages you need from it, or use search_docs and read_doc.

Every tool acts as the signed-in user, with their project roles:
- viewer: read routes, workflows, triggers, custom blocks, middlewares, test suites and logs
- creator: also read app config, integrations, members and packages, change things and run tests
- project_admin: also manage members, packages and project settings
A "You need the X role" error means ask a project admin for that role. Do not retry.

What things are:
- Project: holds everything below. Start with list_projects; most tools need its id.
- Route: an HTTP endpoint (method + path). Its canvas is a graph of blocks that starts at the entrypoint block and ends at a response block.
- Workflow: a background job with its own canvas. It has no URL; a trigger starts it.
- Trigger: what starts a workflow, e.g. a cron schedule or messages from a queue.
- Custom block: a reusable block with your own JavaScript and typed inputs. Its usage says where
  it runs: on a canvas, as a middleware link, or as a test setup/teardown hook.
- Middleware: a named chain of custom blocks that runs before or after a route.
- App config: per-project key/value settings and secrets. Blocks read them by key; never put a
  secret value in a block.
- Integration: a connection to a database, KV store, AI provider or queue. Blocks pick one by id.
- Test suite: a saved request (route) or input (workflow) plus assertions.
- Sandbox: your own private scratch canvas on development data. Try blocks there (e.g. DB Native to inspect a table) with call_sandbox or run_sandbox, without touching real routes.

Building tips:
- Call get_block_schemas with no input to see the built-in blocks, then with blockTypes for the
  exact fields of the ones you will use.
- Edit a canvas with get_canvas, then edit_canvas (small ops, the version you read). Blocks are named
  by key (response_1, db_insert_2): use keys, never ids. edit_canvas lists what each op changed and
  returns rule errors and warnings; check the changes hit the blocks you meant and fix every error.
- Change part of a script with an edit_code op, not by resending the whole field. On a big canvas read get_canvas with compact: true, then blocks: [keys] for the ones you will edit.
- Leave notes: put a short blockDescription on a block whose purpose is not obvious (a workaround, a contract, why a value is parked in a variable), and a sticky_note block for a rule the whole canvas follows. get_canvas shows them; read them before you change plumbing that looks pointless.
- Don't invent topology or style rules. One response block per happy path is fine; don't force several terminal paths onto one block. Never write a note that states a rule the canvas doesn't already follow.
- Keep notes true: after an edit, re-check every blockDescription and sticky note (yours or earlier ones) against the new edges, and fix any the edit made false in the same edit_canvas call.
- Block names (blockName) are unique per canvas and say where the block sits ("200 OK: cached users", "200 OK: users from DB"). Rename a block when you clone it.
- Say "no behaviour change" only after you call the rewired branch with input that takes it (call_route or a test suite), not just any 200.
- Block text inputs are literal unless they start with \`js:\` followed by code that returns the value (e.g. \`js: return input.id\`); never use \`{{ }}\`.
- call_route returns the real error and a short trace of the blocks that ran. Check get_system_logs after a change: compile errors show up there.
- Stop when the tests pass or the route works; don't keep polishing.
- Prefer one route per endpoint; share logic with custom blocks or middlewares.`;
