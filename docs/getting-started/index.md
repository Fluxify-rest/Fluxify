# Getting Started with Fluxify

**Fluxify** is an open-source, no/low-code backend engine that lets you design, deploy, and scale APIs entirely through a visual workflow builder — without writing boilerplate server code.

> [!NOTE]
> Fluxify is currently in **alpha**. The platform is under active development and some features are still stabilizing. Feedback, bug reports, and contributions are very welcome.
## What is Fluxify?

Fluxify is a visual backend platform. Instead of writing route handlers, middleware, and data-access layers manually, you build **workflows** — directed graphs of **Blocks** connected by **Edges** — that define exactly what happens when an HTTP request arrives.

A typical workflow might:

1. Accept an incoming HTTP request via an **Entrypoint** block
2. Read the request body with a **Get Request Body** block
3. Query a PostgreSQL database with a **DB Get Single** block
4. Call an AI model (OpenAI / Anthropic) with an **AI Block**
5. Transform the result with a **Transformer** or **JS Runner** block
6. Return a JSON response with a **Response** block

All of this is configured visually in the browser — no server framework knowledge required.
## Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🧩 **Visual Workflow Builder** | Drag-and-drop blocks onto a canvas to design backend logic — loops, conditions, and error handling included |
| 🗄️ **Database Integration** | Purpose-built PostgreSQL blocks for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records — with raw SQL support |
| 🤖 **AI / LLM Integration** | First-class blocks for calling OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI providers directly from your workflows |
| 📜 **Custom Scripting** | Write JavaScript in a secure sandboxed VM for advanced transformations, custom routing, or JWT handling |
| 🔗 **HTTP Networking** | Call external APIs, inspect headers, manage cookies, and shape responses — all with dedicated HTTP blocks |
| 📡 **Observability** | Structured logging with support for Loki and OpenTelemetry Logs; built-in console logging for local development |
| 🔒 **Security** | Per-project App Config for secrets management, encrypted credentials, and sandbox isolation for scripts |
| 🚀 **Flexible Deployment** | Ship as a standalone Docker container (via `fluxify-kit`), or scale with Kubernetes for high availability |
## How It Works

Every API endpoint in Fluxify is powered by a **workflow**. The platform runs a lightweight execution engine that:

1. **Matches** an incoming HTTP request to the correct workflow via its Entrypoint block.
2. **Creates** a per-request [Execution Context](../concepts/context.md) — an isolated environment holding request data, global variables, the scripting VM, DB connections, and the logger.
3. **Runs** blocks sequentially, passing each block's output as `input` to the next.
4. **Handles errors** by routing to a configured Error Handler block if any block fails.
5. **Enforces** a 4-second execution timeout to prevent runaway workflows.
6. **Returns** the final block's output as the HTTP response.
