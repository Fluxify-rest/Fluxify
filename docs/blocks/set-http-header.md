# Set HTTP Header

The **Set HTTP Header** block allows you to include additional information in your response to the client.

## Inputs

- **Value**: The content of the header.

## Logic

1.  The block adds the specified header to the HTTP response.
2.  This header will be sent back to the client when the workflow finishes.
