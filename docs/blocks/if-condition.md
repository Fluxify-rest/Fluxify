# If Condition

The **If Condition** block splits your workflow into two paths: one for when a condition is true, and another for when it is false.

## Inputs

- **Conditions**: A list of rules to evaluate (e.g., "Variable A equals 10").

## Logic

1.  The block evaluates all provided **Conditions**.
2.  If the result is true, the workflow proceeds to the "Success" path.
3.  If the result is false, the workflow proceeds to the "Error" or "False" path.
