description: The starting point of a workflow.

# Entrypoint

The **Entrypoint** block marks the beginning of your workflow. It receives the initial data (parameters) passed when the workflow is triggered.

## Inputs

This block typically does not have user-configurable inputs as it automatically receives the trigger data.

## Logic

1.  It accepts the initial arguments or request data.
2.  It passes this data immediately to the next block in the chain.
