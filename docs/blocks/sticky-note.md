# Sticky Note

The **Sticky Note** block doesn't perform any logic. Instead, it allows you to place notes directly on your workflow canvas to explain parts of your logic or leave reminders.

## Inputs

- **Notes**: The text content of the note.
- **Color**: The background color of the note (yellow, red, blue, green).
- **Size**: The width and height of the note.

## Logic

This block passes control immediately to the next block without modifying any data. It is purely visual.
