# Get HTTP Request Body

The **Get HTTP Request Body** block retrieves the entire body of the incoming request (e.g., JSON data sent to your API).

## Inputs

This block generally uses the request context and doesn't require specific user inputs.

## Logic

1.  The block reads the body of the incoming HTTP request.
2.  It returns this data as the output, often so you can process it with other blocks.
