# Contributing to Fluxify

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started.

## Reporting Bugs

Open an issue with:
- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Bun / Docker version if relevant

## Suggesting Features

Open an issue tagged `enhancement`. If you'd like to work on it yourself, mention that and we'll assign it to you before you start.

## Pull Requests

We highly recommend using the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for creating PRs and syncing branches for a better developer experience.

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`. **Branch names must be concise, descriptive, and follow standards** (e.g., `feature/add-auth`, `fix/header-alignment`).
2. Follow the existing code style.
3. Add tests where applicable.
4. Open a PR against `main`. **Your PR title and description must clearly articulate the 'Why' and 'What' of the changes**, keeping it concise but informative enough for a seamless review process.

## Local Development
See [self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md) for local setup instructions.
Here's for devs:
- Recommended to use docker-compose for local development
- Use postgres for local database
- Use redis for local cache and pub/sub
- Please fill the .env file properly (see [env.example](env.example) and [self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md) for reference) before running the application
- Use bun for local development and as package manager
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** When you run `bun install`, a Git pre-commit hook is automatically installed. This hook dynamically runs our linter, code analyzer (`fta-cli`), and test suites before every commit to ensure code quality.
- Migrate the database schema using drizzle-kit
- Run the development server using `bun run dev` at root folder which uses turbopack to run all the services
- Access the application at `http://localhost:8080/_/admin/ui`
- API is available at `http://localhost:8080/_/admin/api` and OpenAPI UI is available at `http://localhost:8080/_/admin/api/openapi/ui`
- Before testing, set `DOCKER_HOST="npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine"` (windows) or `DOCKER_HOST="unix://var/run/docker.sock"` (linux/mac) in your terminal or in `.env` file. Required for some integration tests.

## Rules
- Unit tests are mandatory for all new features and bug fixes
- All code must be tested. Our pre-commit hook automatically runs unit tests globally. To keep commits fast, adapter integration tests are skipped unless changes are detected in `packages/adapters/`.
- Docs must be updated for all new features, enhancements or changes
- PRs must be submitted against `main` branch until we have a stable release
- Admin APIs must be documented with OpenAPI spec (see other admin APIs for reference)

## Areas Looking for Contributors

- Integration with other services
- UI/UX improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements
- Documentation improvements (High Priority)
- Testing improvements
- CI/CD improvements
